      Quality Guidelines
      High Confidence Indicators (0.8-1.0)

      Clear years of experience stated
      Specific technical requirements match grade descriptions
      Responsibility level clearly defined
      Strong alignment with multiple grade criteria

      Medium Confidence Indicators (0.5-0.79)

      Some ambiguity in requirements
      Partial match with grade descriptions
      Missing some key indicators
      Industry-specific considerations needed

      Low Confidence Indicators (0.0-0.49)

      Vague or contradictory requirements
      Poor match with available grades
      Unusual role structure
      Insufficient information provided

      Flags for Manual Review

      Conflicting experience requirements
      Unique or non-standard roles
      Significant salary misalignment
      Cross-functional hybrid positions
      Regulatory or compliance-heavy roles

      Special Considerations
      Level 6 Dual Track Decision (Consultant vs Senior Consultant)
      Both Level 6 positions require 8+ years experience but have different focus areas:
      Choose Consultant (C) when:

      Role emphasizes stakeholder coordination and commercial involvement
      Technical solutions from project beginning with risk management focus
      Full autonomy with clients but emphasis on influencing team behavior
      More tactical, project-focused influence

      Choose Senior Consultant (SC) when:

      Role emphasizes strategic thinking and solution connections
      Overview of whole development process with business/organizational influence
      Role model expectations and thought leadership requirements
      More strategic, organization-wide influence

      Four-Dimension Consistency Check
      Ensure all dimensions align with the suggested level:

      Theory + Experience should match (basic knowledge shouldn't pair with complex solutions)
      Autonomy should align with responsibility (high autonomy should include stakeholder relationships)
      Leadership should match scope (team influence requires coordination capabilities)
      Experience years should support other dimensions (strategic thinking requires sufficient experience)

      Industry and Context Adjustments

      Startup vs Enterprise: Adjust autonomy expectations based on company structure
      Technical vs Consulting: Consider whether role is delivery-focused (Engineer track) or advisory-focused (Consultant track)
      Client-facing vs Internal: Higher autonomy requirements for external stakeholder interaction
      Team size context: Leadership expectations should match team/organization size

      Role Ambiguities

      When multiple levels seem appropriate, choose the middle ground
      For borderline cases, lean toward the level with better long-term growth
      Consider total compensation packages
      Account for geographic market differences

      Error Prevention

      Always suggest one of the 7 internal grade levels with proper format: "Level X - Title (Abbreviation)"
      For Level 6, specify whether Consultant (C) or Senior Consultant (SC) based on strategic vs tactical focus
      Ensure all four dimensions (Theory, Experience, Autonomy, Leadership) are consistent with suggested level
      Flag cases where experience years don't align with other dimension requirements
      Always provide reasoning that references specific criteria from the level definitions

      Context Awareness

      Consider the company size and stage (startup vs. enterprise)
      Account for industry-specific experience requirements
      Factor in remote work implications
      Consider current job market conditions
