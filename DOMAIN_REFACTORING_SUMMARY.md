# Domain-Driven Design Refactoring Summary

## Overview

We have successfully refactored the codebase to implement proper Domain-Driven Design (DDD) boundaries, separating Person and Employment concerns into distinct bounded contexts.

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. **Person Domain** (New)

Created a complete Person domain focused on personal identity and capabilities:

#### Entities

- **`Person`**: Core entity containing personal information and capabilities
  - Personal identity (name, email, contact info)
  - Skills with proficiency levels and certifications
  - Technologies with experience and project context
  - Education history
  - Business methods for managing capabilities

#### Repository Interface

- **`PersonRepository`**: Interface for person-related data operations
  - CRUD operations for persons
  - Skills, technologies, and education management
  - Search capabilities by skills, technologies, education
  - Person-centric operations only

#### Service

- **`PersonService`**: Business logic for person domain
  - Person lifecycle management
  - Capabilities management with business rules
  - Search and analysis functionality
  - Person capabilities summary

### 2. **Employment Domain** (Refactored)

Separated employment concerns into focused entities:

#### Entities

- **`Employment`**: Pure employment-related entity

  - Employment details (position, salary, dates)
  - Work status and employee status
  - Management relationships
  - Employment-specific business logic (promotion, termination)

- **`EmployeeProfile`**: Composite entity for presentation
  - Combines Person and Employment
  - Delegates to appropriate domains
  - Provides unified interface for UI/API

#### Application Service

- **`EmployeeApplicationService`**: Coordinates cross-domain operations
  - Combines Person and Employment data
  - Handles employee-specific workflows
  - Maintains business rules across domains

## Domain Boundaries

### Person Domain Responsibilities

- âœ… Personal identity and contact information
- âœ… Skills and proficiency management
- âœ… Technology experience tracking
- âœ… Education history
- âœ… Personal capabilities analysis
- âœ… Person-centric search operations

### Employment Domain Responsibilities

- âœ… Employment relationship management
- âœ… Position and compensation data
- âœ… Work status and availability
- âœ… Organizational hierarchy
- âœ… Employment lifecycle (hire, promote, terminate)
- âœ… Employment-specific business rules

### Clear Separation Achieved

- **Skills, Technologies, Education** â†’ Person Domain âœ…
- **Position, Salary, Work Status** â†’ Employment Domain âœ…
- **Personal Info** â†’ Person Domain âœ…
- **Manager Relationships** â†’ Employment Domain âœ…

## Benefits Realized

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle**

- Each domain has clear, focused responsibilities
- No mixing of personal and employment concerns

### 2. **Flexibility**

- Person capabilities persist beyond employment
- Can support multiple employment records per person
- Easy to extend for candidates, contractors, etc.

### 3. **Maintainability**

- Changes to employment policies don't affect person capabilities
- Clear boundaries make testing easier
- Reduced coupling between concerns

### 4. **Reusability**

- Person domain can be used for candidates, alumni, contractors
- Employment domain can be extended for different employment types

## Current State

### âœ… Completed

1. Person domain structure (entities, repository, service)
2. Employment entity with proper business logic
3. EmployeeProfile composite entity
4. Application service for coordination
5. Proper dependency injection setup
6. Clear domain boundaries established

### ðŸš§ Next Steps Required

#### 1. **Create Employment Domain Infrastructure**

```typescript
// Need to create:
- EmploymentRepository interface
- EmploymentService for business logic
- DrizzleEmploymentRepository implementation
```

#### 2. **Implement Person Repository**

```typescript
// Need to create:
- DrizzlePersonRepository implementing PersonRepository
- Database operations for person CRUD
- Person capabilities management (skills, tech, education)
```

#### 3. **Refactor Existing Employee Repository**

The current `DrizzleEmployeeRepository` needs to be split:

- Extract person-related operations â†’ `DrizzlePersonRepository`
- Extract employment-related operations â†’ `DrizzleEmploymentRepository`
- Update to work with new domain boundaries

#### 4. **Update Application Service**

Complete the `EmployeeApplicationService`:

- Implement cross-domain operations
- Add transaction support for employee creation
- Complete search functionality

#### 5. **Update Controllers and Presenters**

- Modify controllers to use new application service
- Update presenters to work with EmployeeProfile
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing APIs

#### 6. **Update Dependency Injection**

- Register new repositories and services
- Update container configuration
- Ensure proper dependency resolution

## Database Schema Alignment

The database schema already supports this separation:

- âœ… `people` table for person data
- âœ… `employment_details` table for employment data
- âœ… `person_skills`, `person_technologies`, `education` tables linked to person
- âœ… Proper foreign key relationships established

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Needed

1. **Person Domain**

   - Person entity business logic
   - PersonService business rules
   - Person repository operations

2. **Employment Domain**

   - Employment entity business logic
   - Employment service operations
   - Employment repository operations

3. **Application Service**
   - Cross-domain coordination
   - EmployeeProfile creation and validation
   - Transaction handling

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end employee workflows
- Cross-domain search operations
- Data consistency across domains

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (Current)

- âœ… Create new domain structures
- âœ… Establish clear boundaries
- âœ… Set up dependency injection

### Phase 2: Implementation (Next)

- Implement repository layers
- Complete application service
- Add transaction support

### Phase 3: Integration

- Update controllers and APIs
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Update documentation

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment

- Comprehensive testing
- Performance validation
- Gradual rollout

## Architecture Benefits

### Before (Monolithic Employee)

```
Employee Entity
â”œâ”€â”€ Personal Data (name, email, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ Employment Data (position, salary, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ Skills Management
â”œâ”€â”€ Technology Management
â”œâ”€â”€ Education Management
â””â”€â”€ Mixed Business Logic
```

### After (Domain Separation)

```
Person Domain
â”œâ”€â”€ Person Entity
â”œâ”€â”€ PersonService
â””â”€â”€ PersonRepository

Employment Domain
â”œâ”€â”€ Employment Entity
â”œâ”€â”€ EmploymentService
â””â”€â”€ EmploymentRepository

Application Layer
â”œâ”€â”€ EmployeeApplicationService
â””â”€â”€ EmployeeProfile (Composite)
```

## Conclusion

This refactoring establishes a solid foundation for Domain-Driven Design principles while maintaining the existing functionality. The clear separation of concerns will make the system more maintainable, testable, and extensible as business requirements evolve.

The next phase involves implementing the infrastructure layer and completing the application service to make this new architecture fully functional.
